Tasks
0. Basic dictionary
mandatory
Create a class BasicCache that inherits from BaseCaching and is a caching system:

You must use self.cache_data - dictionary from the parent class BaseCaching
This caching system doesn’t have limit
def put(self, key, item):
Must assign to the dictionary self.cache_data the item value for the key key.
If key or item is None, this method should not do anything.
def get(self, key):
Must return the value in self.cache_data linked to key.
If key is None or if the key doesn’t exist in self.cache_data, return None.

1. FIFO caching
mandatory
Create a class FIFOCache that inherits from BaseCaching and is a caching system:

You must use self.cache_data - dictionary from the parent class BaseCaching
You can overload def __init__(self): but don’t forget to call the parent init: super().__init__()
def put(self, key, item):
Must assign to the dictionary self.cache_data the item value for the key key.
If key or item is None, this method should not do anything.
If the number of items in self.cache_data is higher that BaseCaching.MAX_ITEMS:
you must discard the first item put in cache (FIFO algorithm)
you must print DISCARD: with the key discarded and following by a new line
def get(self, key):
Must return the value in self.cache_data linked to key.
If key is None or if the key doesn’t exist in self.cache_data, return None.

2. LIFO Caching
mandatory
Create a class LIFOCache that inherits from BaseCaching and is a caching system:

You must use self.cache_data - dictionary from the parent class BaseCaching
You can overload def __init__(self): but don’t forget to call the parent init: super().__init__()
def put(self, key, item):
Must assign to the dictionary self.cache_data the item value for the key key.
If key or item is None, this method should not do anything.
If the number of items in self.cache_data is higher that BaseCaching.MAX_ITEMS:
you must discard the last item put in cache (LIFO algorithm)
you must print DISCARD: with the key discarded and following by a new line
def get(self, key):
Must return the value in self.cache_data linked to key.
If key is None or if the key doesn’t exist in self.cache_data, return None.

3. LRU Caching
mandatory
Create a class LRUCache that inherits from BaseCaching and is a caching system:

You must use self.cache_data - dictionary from the parent class BaseCaching
You can overload def __init__(self): but don’t forget to call the parent init: super().__init__()
def put(self, key, item):
Must assign to the dictionary self.cache_data the item value for the key key.
If key or item is None, this method should not do anything.
If the number of items in self.cache_data is higher that BaseCaching.MAX_ITEMS:
you must discard the least recently used item (LRU algorithm)
you must print DISCARD: with the key discarded and following by a new line
def get(self, key):
Must return the value in self.cache_data linked to key.
If key is None or if the key doesn’t exist in self.cache_data, return None.

4. MRU Caching
mandatory
Create a class MRUCache that inherits from BaseCaching and is a caching system:

You must use self.cache_data - dictionary from the parent class BaseCaching
You can overload def __init__(self): but don’t forget to call the parent init: super().__init__()
def put(self, key, item):
Must assign to the dictionary self.cache_data the item value for the key key.
If key or item is None, this method should not do anything.
If the number of items in self.cache_data is higher that BaseCaching.MAX_ITEMS:
you must discard the most recently used item (MRU algorithm)
you must print DISCARD: with the key discarded and following by a new line
def get(self, key):
Must return the value in self.cache_data linked to key.
If key is None or if the key doesn’t exist in self.cache_data, return None.

5. LFU Caching
#advanced
Create a class LFUCache that inherits from BaseCaching and is a caching system:

You must use self.cache_data - dictionary from the parent class BaseCaching
You can overload def __init__(self): but don’t forget to call the parent init: super().__init__()
def put(self, key, item):
Must assign to the dictionary self.cache_data the item value for the key key.
If key or item is None, this method should not do anything.
If the number of items in self.cache_data is higher that BaseCaching.MAX_ITEMS:
you must discard the least frequency used item (LFU algorithm)
if you find more than 1 item to discard, you must use the LRU algorithm to discard only the least recently used
you must print DISCARD: with the key discarded and following by a new line
def get(self, key):
Must return the value in self.cache_data linked to key.
If key is None or if the key doesn’t exist in self.cache_data, return None.
